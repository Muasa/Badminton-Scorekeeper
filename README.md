# Badminton-Scorekeeper

This court counter is reflective of the scoring rules in badminton. When one wins a rally, a point is scored. Similarly, when a player commits a foul, the opponent gets a point. Counting from 0, the first player to score 21 points wins the game. In the event that both players have a 20-20 tie, the first to lead by two points wins the game. Additionally, the first player to score 30 points with a one point lead also wins. In this scorekeeper, fouls can be added and the counter can be reset.
